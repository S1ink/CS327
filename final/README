Begins a simple, interactive fluid simulation using the FLIP method.
(Note that this is meant to be more aesthetic than physically accurate)

**BUILD**:
    Run `make`

**USAGE**:
    Run: `./fluid`

*Controls*:
    - Acceleration direction is controlled by the arrow keys
        (no acceleration when no keys are pressed)
    - Spacebar pauses/unpauses the simulation
    - 'q' or Ctrl+C closes terminates the program

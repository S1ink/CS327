Begins a simple, interactive fluid simulation using the FLIP method.

By default, no acceleration is applied. Holding the arrow keys applies
a directional acceleration, or "screensaver mode" can be enabled to
randomly move the fluid without user input (and is very satisfying to
watch). Finally, resizing the window will cause the fluid to collide
with the updated boundary size.

(Note that this is meant to be more aesthetic than physically accurate)

**BUILD**:
    Run `make`

**USAGE**:
    Run: `./fluid`

*Controls*:
 * Arrow Keys    : Hold to apply acceleration
 * Space or 'p'  : Play/pause
 * 'm'           : Toggle "screensaver mode"
 * 'h' or '?'    : Show/hide info screen
 * 's'           : Show/hide statistics
 * 'S'           : Show/hide advanced statistics
 * 'l'           : Toggle light/dark mode (half baked)
 * Ctrl+C or 'q' : Quit the program

Initializes a dungeon, randomly spawns monsters, and iterates through a simulated game. All monsters behave according to
the 1.04 spec (for each hex number), and the PC targets a random floor location, while attacking any monsters in close proximity.
The game automatically terminates with an appropriate end screen when either the PC dies or all monsters are killed. Ctrl+C may be
pressed anytime to terminate the program gracefully.

**BUILD**:
    Run `make`
*Optionally, to enable colored output*:
    Run `make rebuild OPT=colorful`
*And to enable debug printing*:
    Run `make rebuild OPT=debug`

**USAGE**:
    Run: `./game <--load> <--save> <--nummon #>`
*Flags*:
    `--load`   : Loads the saved dungeon located at `$HOME/.rlg327/dungeon`. If nonexistent, exits with an error message.
    `--save`   : Generates a new dungeon (unless the load flag is present), and saves it to `$HOME/.rlg327/dungeon`.
    `--nummon` : Specify the number of monsters to spawn. Valid range is [0, 255] (256 overflows to 0).

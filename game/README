The program in its current state generates a randomly seeded dungeon (based on the current time)
according to the assignment specification, and outputs it to the terminal. Internally,
structures for the dungeon, it's rooms, and cell information are contained in `src/dungeon.h`.
Dungeon parameters are in `src/dungeon_config.h`, and the actual generation algorithm is
implemented in `src/dungeon.c`.

The generation algorithm first calculates a hardness value for each cell in the dungeon, which is
based on perlin noise. Next, a random number of minimum-size rooms are inserted, and subsequently
"grown" a random amount to create a variation in room sizes. Lastly, random corridor start and end
points are chosen and connected.

The program can be compiled by running `make`, and run by executing `./game`.

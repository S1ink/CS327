Initializes a dungeon, randomly spawns monsters, and starts a playable game (using ncurses). All controls listed in the
1.05 specification are implemented, as well as the following:
 1. Ctrl+C exits the program (as well as 'Q').
 2. 'H' displays the hardness map (in color).
 3. 'D' displays the floor weightmap (in color).
 4. 'T' displays the terrain weightmap (in color).
 5. 's' displays the default map, if another was being displayed.

**BUILD**:
    Run `make`

**USAGE**:
    Run: `./game <--load> <--save> <--nummon #>`
*Flags*:
    `--load`   : Loads the saved dungeon located at `$HOME/.rlg327/dungeon`. If nonexistent, exits with an error message.
    `--save`   : Generates a new dungeon (unless the load flag is present), and saves it to `$HOME/.rlg327/dungeon`.
    `--nummon` : Specify the number of monsters to spawn. Valid range is [0, 255] (256 overflows to 0, 0 results in an instant win).

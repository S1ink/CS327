Generates or loads a dungeon, initializes monsters/items based on supplied
config files, and begins a playable game. All commands are implemented
according to 1.09 assignment spec, including the following:
 1. Ctrl+C exits the program (as well as 'Q').
 2. 'H' displays the hardness map (in color).
 3. 'D' displays the floor weightmap (in color).
 4. 'T' displays the terrain weightmap (in color).
 5. 's' displays the default map, if another was being displayed.
Please note that attempting to exit the game while viewing the inventory or
targetting a monster has not been implemented and will not work.

**BUILD**:
    Run `make`

**USAGE**:
    Run: `./game <--load> <--save> <--nummon #> <--seed #>`

*Flags*:
    `--load`   : Loads the saved dungeon located at `$HOME/.rlg327/dungeon`.
                    If nonexistent, exits with an error message.
    `--save`   : Generates a new dungeon (unless the load flag is present),
                    and saves it to `$HOME/.rlg327/dungeon`.
    `--nummon` : Specify the number of monsters to spawn. Valid range is
                    [0, 255] (256 overflows to 0, 0 results in an instant win).
    `--seed`   : Provide a seed to initialize the dungeon.

Desc : "All decked out in a brand new Chilton uniform, she talks faster than anybody
you've ever known.  She's dual-wielding Proust's "Rememberance of Things

with a litany of cultural references from which you'll never recover."

Powerpoint, but without computers.  You've probably never seen one before

by one of these, make sure to block high.

Desc : "  "Are you ready, kids?!?!"
  "I can't hear you!"

He lives in a pineapple under the sea.  He's enormous and yellow and porous.
And he's tired of flipping Krabby Patties and playing unofficial sidekick and
the ocean's biggest fan to Mermaid Man.  Each of those billions of pores is
saturated with soaked-up malevolence, and all of it is focused on you.

SpongeBob rules the dungeons of 327.  He'll coat the dungeon floor with your
blood and soak it right up to increase his power."

made out of polyurethane foam.

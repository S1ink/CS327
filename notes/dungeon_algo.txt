EASIEST:
* standard terminal is 80 x 24 characters
* --> reserve 3 rows for status messages
* --> left with 80 x 21 characters
* border characters are "immutable" -- must be rock

1. Select random (x, y) within dungeon range, select smaller (x, y) in room range -- these become room bounding boxes
    * Rooms MAY NOT overlap
2. Put rooms in array (position + size)
3. Pick positions in one dungeon and another dungeon and connect them with tunnels
    * Tunnels can "go through" rooms
    * Better: keep track of which rooms have been connected to minimize tunnels

SHAEFER VERSION:
1. "Start with the rock" -- seed with hardnesses (put in a queue)
2. spread out hardnesses
3. gaussian convolution to blur
4. add rooms
5. Use djikstras to path find (based on hardness)
6. add a loop

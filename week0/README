This wordsearch generator takes an integer argument {0 < n < 21} followed by an unbounded list of words that should be inserted into the generated grid.
Values of n greater than 20 will be capped at 20, and values of n less than 0 will result in the size being calculated from the maximum length of any input string.
In the event that all available positions and all available directions for a given string are tested, and no compatible space is found, the program will print an error and return.

To build, execute `make` while in the directory with the makefile.
The built program will be in the same directory and named `wordsearch`.
For example, you can run `./wordsearch 14 apple banana grape orange`.
